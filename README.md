# Deeplabcut-plotting-functions
When using the AlexEMG/Deeplabcut toolbox for plotting the histogram of likelihood, 
the large amount of frames and several bodyparts overlap in one figure. 
This makes the legibility pretty low. 
This python file helps separate the bodyparts and plot the histogram of likelihood-count (cumulative&normed are plotted as well).
